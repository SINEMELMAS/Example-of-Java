### Key Features of Java:
1. **Object-Oriented**: Follows OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
2. **Platform-Independent**: Code written in Java runs on any platform with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
3. **Robust and Secure**: Includes strong memory management and built-in security features.
4. **Multi-threading**: Supports concurrent execution of threads for efficient processing.
5. **Rich Standard Library**: Provides extensive libraries for data structures, networking, I/O, and more.

### Use Cases of Java
1. **Web Development**
   - Build scalable web applications using frameworks like Spring and Hibernate.
   - Develop RESTful APIs for microservices architecture.

2. **Mobile App Development**
   - Create Android applications using Java.
   - Integrate features like database access and user authentication.

3. **Enterprise Software**
   - Develop large-scale enterprise systems for banking, healthcare, and more.
   - Use Java EE for business logic implementation.

4. **Game Development**
   - Build 2D and 3D games using Java libraries like LWJGL or jMonkeyEngine.

5. **Big Data and Machine Learning**
   - Work with Hadoop and Spark for big data processing.
   - Use Java ML libraries like Weka and Deeplearning4j for machine learning.

6. **IoT and Embedded Systems**
   - Create IoT applications with Java’s flexibility and portability.
   - Control embedded devices like Raspberry Pi.

### Advantages of Java
- **Versatility**: Suitable for a wide range of applications.
- **Community Support**: Extensive community and resources for learning and troubleshooting.
- **Cross-Platform**: "Write once, run anywhere" philosophy ensures portability.
- **Performance**: Efficient performance through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

### Example Java Programs

1. **Hello World Program**
   ```java
   public class HelloWorld {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           System.out.println("Hello, World!");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Basic Arithmetic**
   ```java
   public class Arithmetic {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           int a = 10, b = 20;
           System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
           System.out.println("Difference: " + (a - b));
           System.out.println("Product: " + (a * b));
           System.out.println("Quotient: " + (a / b));
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Reading User Input**
   ```java
   import java.util.Scanner;

   public class UserInput {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
           System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
           String name = scanner.nextLine();
           System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
           scanner.close();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Object-Oriented Example**
   ```java
   class Car {
       String model;
       int year;

       // Constructor
       public Car(String model, int year) {
           this.model = model;
           this.year = year;
       }

       // Method
       public void displayInfo() {
           System.out.println("Model: " + model + ", Year: " + year);
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Car car = new Car("Toyota Corolla", 2020);
           car.displayInfo();
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Multi-threading**
   ```java
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
       }
   }

   public class MultiThreading {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();
           MyThread thread2 = new MyThread();
           thread1.start();
           thread2.start();
       }
   }
   ```
